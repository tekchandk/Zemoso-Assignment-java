A type of glass that bends like plastic has been created by copying seashells. It could be used to make safer windows, more shatterproof screens for phones and even foldable screens that don’t scratch easily.

“We can make a piece of glass that drastically deforms like a piece of plastic,” says Francois Barthelat at McGill University in Canada. “It duplicates what we see in seashells.”

Mother-of-pearl, or nacre – the iridescent material that lines the inside of many seashells – is made mostly of brittle calcium carbonate. But it is extremely tough and strong because the calcium carbonate is arranged in tiny hexagonal platelets joined by flexible biopolymers.

When this material is struck, the platelets can slide over each other as the polymers stretch, dissipating the energy of the impact instead of shattering. Extreme forces can rip the platelets apart but the resulting cracks don’t spread as they do in materials like glass.
